                <h3>Zdzisław Beksiński,<i> Untitled</i></h3>
                <p>In the medieval tradition, Beksinski seems to believe art to be a forewarning about the fragility of
                    the flesh – whatever pleasures we know are doomed to perish – thus, his paintings manage to evoke at
                    once the process of decay and the ongoing struggle for life. They hold within them a secret poetry,
                    stained with blood and rust.</p>

                <p>It was most likely painted in the winter of 1885–86 as a satirical comment on conservative academic
                    practices. Before it was common to use live humans as models, the academic routine included the
                    study of skeletons to develop an understanding of human anatomy.</p>

                <p>As well as being a double portrait, the painting contains a still life of several meticulously
                    rendered objects, the meaning of which is the cause of much debate. It also incorporates a
                    much-cited example of anamorphosis in painting. The most notable and famous of Holbein's symbols in
                    the work is the distorted skull which is placed in the bottom center of the composition.</p>

                <p>The painter's time in Italy proved to be the finest and stylistically most innovative period of his
                    entire career. He subscribed almost immediately to Caravaggio's revolution, and his earliest work
                    reveals all the raw strength of a young northern artist dazzled by Caravaggio's naturalism.</p>

                <h3> Peter Paul Rubens, <i>The Massacre of the Innocents</i></h3>
                <p>It is widely regarded as a demonstration of the artist's learnings from his time spent in Italy
                    between 1600 and 1608, where he observed first-hand the works of Italian Baroque painters like
                    Caravaggio. These influences are seen in this painting through the sheer drama and emotive dynamism
                    of the scene, as well as the rich colour. There is also evidence of the use of chiaroscuro. He also
                    used ecorche figures - anatomical statues with the skin removed-to study how the body was made.</p>

                <p>The painting shows the killing by flaying or skinning alive of Marsyas, a satyr who rashly challenged
                    the god Apollo to a musical contest. It is one of several canvases with mythological subjects from
                    Ovid which Titian executed in his late years, mostly the poesie series for King Philip II of Spain,
                    of which this painting seems not to have been part.</p>

                <p>The muted colors as the dark or evil side is winning in this stand off and that observation works in
                    tandem with St.Anthony being on the ground on his back, completely at the mercy of the demons coming
                    into the frame. The more it looks real, the
                    more it can be percieved as an actual threat. We’re not scared by something that can be easily
                    dismissable due to its caricature state. These aforementioned elements do not exactly inspire awe,
                    but they definitely entice an emotional response. It’s not something that you want to be taking in a
                    lot of.</p>

                <p>According to the traditional interpretation, it depicts the Greek myth of the Titan Cronus (in the
                    title Romanized to Saturn), who, fearing that he would be overthrown by one of his children, ate
                    each one upon their birth. The work is one of the 14 Black Paintings that Goya painted directly onto
                    the walls of his house sometime between 1819 and 1823.</p>

                    aging, witches in a moonlit barren landscape. The Devil seems to be
                    acting as a sort of priest at an initiation ceremony for the children, although popular superstition
                    at the time believed the Devil often fed on children and human fetuses. The dead body of an infant
                    can be seen discarded to the left, whereas the legs of another can be seen held down with force to
                    the ground by a presumably younger witch in the center foreground.</p>

                <p>The picture shows one of the panels of the Triptych of Earthly Vanity and Divine Salvation which is
                    made up of three panels, all three of which are painted on both sides. This reversible painting
                    would seem to have been intended for use as an aid to private meditation. When the panels are folded
                    slightly inwards, the triptych will stand unsupported - for example, on a table. Its symbolism
                    centres on the opposition between Good and Evil. To one side of the woman, representing vanity and
                    lust, is an androgynous devil. This figure bears a premonitory sentence.</p>

                    criminals, amputees and deceased persons. He took these grisly prizes to his studios where he
                    allowed them to decompose, watching and sketching the results as time and bacteria wreaked their
                    havoc on the pieces – a very early kind of 'body farm' style investigation.</p>

                <h3>Theodore Gericault, <i>The Severed Heads</i></h3>
                <p>Guillotine heads by Gericault's show a cruel description of decay and death. On the left side is the
                    female head which has closed eyes and bright white skin, while on the right is the male head with
                    open mouth and open eyes which look at the viewer freely. Serrated, rough spots on the neck
                    illustrate the cruel and torturous death these characters have agonized at the guillotine.</p>

                    painting captures its final moments in silence before being atrociously defeated. Blood pours down
                    in many streaks, while the mouth hangs wide open baring teeth. With brows creased and eyes
                    amplified, an appalling expression is portrayed.</p>

                    located the spot to a fjord overlooking Oslo, and have suggested other explanations for the
                    unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction
                    by Munch to his sister’s commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum.</p>

                <h3>Francis Bacon, <i>Portrait of Pope Innocent X</i></h3>
                <p>The work shows a distorted version of the Portrait of Innocent X painted by Spanish artist Diego
                    Velázquez in 1650. The work is one of the first in a series of around 50 variants of the Velázquez
                    painting which Bacon executed. Almost all of the popes are shown within cage-like structures and
                    screaming or about to scream. Bacon identified as a Nietzschean and atheist, and some contemporary
                    critics saw the series as symbolic execution scenes, as if Bacon sought to enact Nietzsche's
                    declaration that "God is dead" by killing his representative on Earth. Other critics see the series
                    as symbolizing the killing of a father figure.</p>

                <p>In 1943, Albright was commissioned to create the titular painting for Albert Lewin's film adaptation
                    of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray. His naturalistic, exaggerated depictions of decay made
                    him suited to create the image of the corrupted Dorian. His brother was originally chosen to do the
                    beginning, uncorrupted painting of Gray. However, the painting used in the final film was from
                    Henrique Medina. When changes to Medina's painting were needed to show Gray's fall, Albright painted
                    them.</p>

                    identical faces. In their mouths and eyes are more identical faces in a process implied to be
                    infinite. Swarming around the large face are biting serpents. In the lower right corner is a hand

                    could be a representation of De Chirico's love of classical art and a disappearing age. De Chirico
                    uses the rubber glove as a mold of a hand that implies the void of human presence. The buildings set
                    up a scene that is reminiscent of the cityscapes of De Chirico's past.</p>

                <h3>Hieronymus Bosch, <i>The Garden of Earthly Delights</i></h3>
                <p>Bosch depicts a world in which humans have succumbed to temptations that lead to evil and reap
                    eternal damnation. The tone of this final panel strikes a harsh contrast to those preceding it. The
                    scene is set at night, and the natural beauty that adorned the earlier panels is noticeably absent.
                    Compared to the warmth of the center panel, the right wing possesses a chilling quality—rendered
                    through cold colourisation and frozen waterways—and presents a tableau that has shifted from the
                    paradise of the center image to a spectacle of cruel torture and retribution. In a single, densely
                    detailed scene, the viewer is made witness to cities on fire in the background; war, torture
                    chambers, infernal taverns, and demons in the midground; and mutated animals feeding on human flesh
                    in the foreground. The nakedness of the human figures has lost all its eroticism, and many now
                    attempt to cover their genitalia and breasts with their hands, ashamed by their nakedness.</p>

                <p>The Nightmare simultaneously offers both the image of a dream by indicating the effect of the
                    nightmare on the woman and a dream image in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts
                    a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed with her head hanging down, exposing her long neck.
                    She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying
                    on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set
                    against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to
                    create strong contrasts between light and shade. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head
                    of a horse

                    an alp, the life crushed from her, vacantly staring at the viewer and lacking comprehension of his
                    crime. The lit trees transparently represent the mother and child, the one a sapling, the other
                    fully-grown, each bound to its associated character at their waist, suggesting a strange outlook on
                    fertility and birth in line with that already presented by the human subjects and the title.</p>

                <h3>Max Klinger, <i>A Glove</i></h3>
                <p>The cycle of etchings begins at a skating rink in Berlin where Klinger himself is in the etching and
                    admires a young woman. As the story goes on, people are skating and the young woman happens to drop
                    her glove. Klinger swoops in to pick it up, losing his hat in the process. The glove becomes a
                    fetish item and possesses a power over Klinger. Then the story starts to change into imaginative
                    dimensions in which the intimate and potently sexualized object triggers a series of elaborate
                    visions of longing and loss, conveyed through hallucinatory distortions of scale and jarring
                    juxtapositions. The glove torments Klinger because he doesn't return it to the woman and keeps it to
                    himself. Klinger gives the glove personality in the etchings. The glove will get away from Klinger
                    multiple times in different scenes where he struggles to get it back. It also gives Klinger
                    nightmares in the etching Anxieties, in the style of Goya. The glove eventually gets stolen from him
                    in the night by a dreamlike creature in Abduction. In the last etching, Cupid, the viewer sees the
                    glove lying on a table with Cupid sitting next to it.</p>

                <h3>Robert Mapplethorpe, <i>Lisa Lyon</i></h3>
                <p>His work featured an array of subjects, including celebrity portraits, male and female nudes,
                    self-portraits, and still-life images. His most controversial works documented and examined the
                    homosexual male BDSM subculture of New York City in the late 1960s and early 1970s. A 1989
                    exhibition of Mapplethorpe's work, titled Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment, sparked a debate
                    in the United States concerning both use of public funds for "obscene" artwork and the
                    Constitutional limits of free speech in the United States.</p>

                <h3>Robert Mapplethorpe, <i>Louise Bourgeois</i></h3>
                <p>In this black and white portrait photograph the French-American artist Louise Bourgeois stands
                    slightly to the right of the frame against a plain grey background. She is shown from her waist up
                    with her body in three quarter profile, and her face turned towards the camera. She wears a dark,
                    tufted monkey fur coat and has one of her sculptures tucked under her right arm, holding it in place
                    with her right hand. This phallic shaped sculpture, Fillette, which translates as ‘little girl’ in
                    French, is a plaster work covered in latex made fourteen years earlier. Bourgeois smiles somewhat
                    mischievously at the camera.</p>

                <h3>Joan Miró, <i>Object</i></h3>
                <p>Stuffed parrot on wood perch, stuffed silk stocking with velvet garter and doll paper shoe suspended
                    in hollow wood frame, derby hat, hanging cork ball, celluloid fish, and engraved map. How did I
                    think up my drawings and my ideas for painting? Well I'd come home to my Paris studio in Rue Blomet
                    at night, I'd go to bed, and sometimes I hadn't any supper. I saw things, and I jotted them down in
                    a notebook. I saw shapes on the ceiling.</p>

                <h3>Marcel Duchamp, <i>Prelude to a Broken Arm</i></h3>
                <p>Consists of a regular snow shovel with "from Marcel Duchamp 1915" painted on the handle. One
                    explanation for the title is that without the shovel to remove snow, one might fall and break an
                    arm. This type of humor is not atypical of dadaist work. At the time, the term "ready-made" referred
                    to manufactured goods as opposed to handmade goods, but Duchamp used the term to describe "an
                    ordinary object elevated to the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of an artist".</p>
